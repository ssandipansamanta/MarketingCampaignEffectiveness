# Marketing Campaign Effectiveness

## Introduction

```
As part of a marketing campaign to increase customer spend and loyalty, 
client sent out coupons to 4000 buyers by post. Each buyer received one coupon for $10 
which they could spend on client.com in a two week window between the 5th and 18th January 2015. 
Some buyers used their coupon to get money off their purchases in that time (Redeemers) and 
others chose not to (Non-Redeemers). A third group of shoppers (Control) were not sent 
a coupon but will act as a benchmark as we assess whether the coupons successfully 
boosted customer spending as hoped.
```

What's is the spend distribution over the 12 week period between 24th November 14 and 9th February 15 i.e. 6 weeks before the coupon 'drop date' to 6 weeks after. Please compare the results for each group (Control, Test-Redeemers, Test-NonRedeemers).

What is the incremental spend in the six weeks after the coupons were sent (additional spend above what we would have expected had no coupon been sent out) for the total Test group (Redeemers and Non-Redeemers) vs. Control?  

Calculate revenue as Revenue = Spend x Take Rate. Assuming that Take Rate is 10% and that the cost of the coupon campaign is equal to the value of a coupon multiplied by the number of coupons redeemed, calculate the ROI of this campaign.
